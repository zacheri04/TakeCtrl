## About

TakeCtrl is a lightweight Mac menu bar app that allows bypassing of some default macOS keyboard and mouse behaviors such as:
- Control + Left Click = Right Click
- Shift + Scroll Wheel = Horizontal Scroll

It's useful for games like Minecraft where you may want to sprint (with the Control key pressed) while left clicking, or use the scroll wheel to select items.

Supports Open at Login functionality.
